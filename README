This is the back-end and API project for Rainwave 4.

Required Python modules:
	- pyinotify
	- tornado
	- sqlite3
	- psycopg2
	- pylibmc
	- mutagen
	- nose
	- PIL (Python Image Library, on Debian: python-imaging)

Recommended .git/hooks/pre-commit:
	#!/bin/bash
	python runtests.py --api
	exit $?

To get started on helping with this project:
	- Clone it
	- python runtests.py
	- Fix failing scenarios

You may notice throughout the program that many UPDATE statements are
broken out into loops, rather than letting the database handle it in a JOIN.
There's a reason for this, and until there's a better
way of handling these scenarios, they are greppable by searching for
SQLITE_CANNOT_DO_JOINS_ON_UPDATES.
